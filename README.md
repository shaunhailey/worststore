"Worste Store" was created for a class assignment during my Iron Yard tenure. It is a mockup of a store's website. I decided to have some fun with it and create the worst store website ever! This is a React app, and the point of the assignment was to explore React Router and Navlinks, which are omnipresent throughout the project.
